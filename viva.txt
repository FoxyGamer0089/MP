 Basic SQL & Key Concepts

1. What is a Primary Key?
 A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It can’t have NULL or duplicate values.

2. What are Keys in SQL?
 Keys are used to identify rows and make relationships between tables.
Examples: Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Key, Candidate Key.

3. What are Constraints?
 Constraints are rules applied to columns to maintain data accuracy.
Examples: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT.

4. NOT NULL & UNIQUE Constraints
 NOT NULL: Value must be given (no NULLs).
 UNIQUE: All values must be different (only one NULL allowed).

5. What is a Cursor?
 A cursor is used to fetch query results row by row. Useful in procedures when processing each row separately.

6. What is a Trigger?
 A trigger automatically runs when a table event happens (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Used for data checks and maintaining integrity.

 SQL Commands

7. Syntax of UPDATE command:

UPDATE table_name 
SET column1 = value1 
WHERE condition;

8. Define DDL & DML Commands:
 DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines database objects.
Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
 DML (Data Manipulation Language): Manages data inside tables.
Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

9. Common DDL Syntax:

CREATE TABLE table_name (...);
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
DROP TABLE table_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

10. Common DML Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table_name;
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (...);
UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

11. Uses of ALTER TABLE:
 Add, modify, or delete a column.
 Add or remove constraints.

12. Meaning of % and _ in LIKE:
 % – any number of characters.
 _ – exactly one character.
Example: WHERE name LIKE 'A%'

13. Trigger Syntax:

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE|AFTER INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   -- statements
END;

 Differences

14. TRUNCATE vs DELETE:

Feature	TRUNCATE	DELETE

Type	DDL	DML
Rollback	No	Yes
WHERE clause	Not allowed	Allowed
Speed	Faster	Slower


15. Procedure vs Trigger:

Feature	Procedure	Trigger

Called by	User	Automatically
Parameters	Yes	No
Event-based	No	Yes


16. DROP vs DELETE:

Feature	DROP	DELETE

Removes	Whole table	Only rows
Rollback	No	Yes
Type	DDL	DML

 Advanced SQL Features

17. What is a Foreign Key?
 A column that refers to the Primary Key of another table to maintain relationship.

Example:

FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID);

18. What is a View?
 A view is a virtual table showing data from one or more tables.
Used for simplicity, security, and consistency.

19. What are Aggregate Functions?
 Functions that perform calculations on multiple rows and return one result.

20. Examples of Aggregate Functions:
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()

21. Types of JOINs:

INNER JOIN: Matching rows in both tables

LEFT JOIN: All from left + matches from right

RIGHT JOIN: All from right + matches from left

FULL JOIN: All from both tables


22. String Functions:

UPPER()/LOWER(): Change case

LENGTH(): Count characters

SUBSTRING(): Extract part of string

CONCAT(): Join strings

TRIM(): Remove spaces


23. Foreign Key Constraint:
 Ensures values in child table match primary key values in parent table (referential integrity).

24. Constraints in SQL:
 Rules like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT.
